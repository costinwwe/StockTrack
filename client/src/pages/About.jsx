            <h3>Sole Developer & Founder</h3>
            <p>
              StockTrack was built from the ground up by a single developer with a passion for creating
              efficient business solutions. After witnessing the frustration of manual inventory management
              firsthand, I decided to build a tool that would solve these problems once and for all.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every feature in StockTrack comes from direct feedback from business owners and inventory managers.
              This isn't just softwareâ€”it's a solution designed by someone who understands your challenges.
